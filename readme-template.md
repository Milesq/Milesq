<!-- I am a self-taught programmer who is passionate about programming. Hater of the educational system. I began learning at the age of 15 - before I went to IT high school. Immediately following graduation, I went to work as a full-time developer. -->

<!-- I started learning programming at the age of 15, {{ DAYS }} days ago. A few weeks after I got a stable internet access. I began learning how to build websites with HTML&CSS, then fell into C++ & JS -->
Learning programming for {{ DAYS }} days

I am a passionate, mid developer, aiming to specialise in advanced cloud solutions by leveraging the strengths of low-level languages such as Rust and Go. I am fascinated by the syntax and elegance of these modern languages, which provide high performance, security and great developer experience.

My relationship with programming began in my teenage years and I am constantly striving to improve my skills and knowledge.

Outside of coding, I enjoy complex board games, tea, physics and the philosophy of science.

I believe in the importance of humility and keeping my ego in check, which helps me stay open to learning and growing. PS Ego is your enemy
